This is basically flashcards with points. I really am not sure how better to describe it. It asks questions and gives points based on if you're right or wrong and how long you took to answer. Gamified flashcards.

Honestly it isn't really done but I've hit a few weird issues that gave me the run around for over an hour each. Currently there is a runaway loop function that no amount of if statements has managed to stop. I need a break. If I can come back and finish this tomorrow then I'll happily do so but for now, I can't code anymore. I didn't make a page for highscores and used an alert window instead. The runaway loop function immediately closes all but the score submission page.
